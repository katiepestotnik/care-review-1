//Conditionals
//1. Make a temp variable.
//2. Write a chaining conditional statement that
// - checks if the temp is > 90 and logs 'it is hot'
// - checks if temp is > 70 and logs 'it is pretty nice'
// - finally a catch all (else) with a log of 'nothing above is truthy'


//Loops
const foods = ['pizza', 'ice cream', 'salad']
//1. Write a loop of your choice that loops through the above array and logs each element with a string added, 'is sooo good!'


//Arrays
const movies = ['Pan\'s Labyrinth', 'Crimson Peak', 'Hellboy']
// 1. Access the last element in the above array.
// 2. Change Crimson Peak to your favorite movie.
// 3. Add the string of 'Ghost' to the front of the array with an array method.
// 4. Loop through the array with the forEach() array method. 


//Objects
const myDog = {
    name: 'Klondike',
    breed: 'Golden Retriever',
    activies: ['fetching the ball', 'hiking'],
    age: 6
}
//1.  Access the string of hiking in the myDog object.
//2.  Update the age key of myDog to 7.
//3.  Loop through myDog and log the values of each key.

//Functions
function calculate(num1, num2, operator){
    let result
}
console.log(calculate(2, 4, 'add'))
//1.  What are the parameters of this function?
//2.  What are the arguments in the example above?
//3.  What is the purpose of return
//4.  Complete this function so that when the function runs it returns a result of 8.
//5.  If I console.log(result) outside of the function, what would you expect and why?
